title: Measure Theory
---

Measure theory is the study of __measures__ on a set, which are assignments of a "size" to some of its subsets. Measures give rise to the theory of __Lebesgue integration__, which is more general and has better properties than Riemann integration.

These notes closely follow the graduate course MA5205 Graduate Analysis I, offered in AY2018/19 Semester 1 by Prof Denny Leung.
