title: Algebraic Number Theory
---

Algebraic number theory is concerned with __number fields__, finite extensions of $\bb Q$, whose elements are the __algebraic numbers__. It uses the methods of algebra to study notions from number theory, such as primes and factorisation.

These notes follow the graduate course MA5202 Number Theory, offered in AY2018/19 Semester 2 by Prof Chin Chee Whye. The main text for this course is D. A. Marcus, _Number Fields_, 2nd ed. (2018).
