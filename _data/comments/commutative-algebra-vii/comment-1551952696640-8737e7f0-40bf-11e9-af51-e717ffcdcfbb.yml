comment: "Eakin-Nagata's theorem reminds me of Artin-Tate's lemma: Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, $B \\subset C$ algebras over $A$. If $C$ is a finitely generated as an $A$-algebra, and $C$ is a finite $B$-module, then $B$ is also a finitely generated $A$-algebra. \r\n\r\nSo over here, the Noetherian property is replaced by finitely generated which is also a measure of \"smallness\". The proof can be found on Wikipedia and is pretty short but I think rather tricky. The lemma was invented to prove Hilbert's Nullstellensatz  (according to Wikipedia, and through Zariski's lemma I believe) but it has a neat application to invariant theory.\r\n\r\n Let $K$ be a field, $R = K[x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n]$ the polynomial ring over $K$ in $n$ variables and let $G$ be a group of $K$-automorphisms on $R$. Then a classical problem in invariant theory is to determine the ring $$R^G = \\{ r \\mid g \\cdot r = r \\text{ for all } g \\in G \\},$$\r\nalso known as the ring of invariants under $G$. More precisely, one can ask whether $R^G$ is finitely generated as a $K$-algebra, and if so, what is a possible set of generators. \r\n\r\nWhen $G$ is of finite size, we can apply Artin-Tate lemma by letting $A = K, B = R^G$ and $C = R$. Then all one has to show is that $R$ is finitely generated as a $R^G$-module, which it then suffices to show that $R$ is an integral extension of $R^G$ (actually equivalent by Nakayama). Now we borrow a construction from Galois theory: given $r \\in R$, we consider the polynomial \r\n$$P(t) = \\prod_{g \\in G} (t - g \\cdot r)$$\r\nwhich expands out to polynomial with coefficients in $R^G$ that $r$ satisfies, since $1_G \\cdot r = r$. The conclusion then follows.\r\n\r\nUsing Easkin-Nagata, one can also immediately conclude that $R^G$ is Noetherian since $R$ is Noetherian by Hilbert basis and under some additional natural conditions such as elements of $G$ send homogeneous polynomials to homogeneous polynomials, is enough to conclude that $R^G$ is finitely generated. I would like to mention another proof that $R^G$ is Noetherian, which is closer to Hilbert's original proof for $G = SL_n$.\r\n\r\nJust like Formanek's theorem, given a chain of ideals \\{I_j\\} in $R^G$ we extend it to $R$ via $\\{I_j R\\}$. Then as $R$ is Noetherian, this chain will stabilize and hopefully we can conclude that the $\\{ I_j \\}$ will stabilize too. The issue arises when one could have distinct $I_j$'s such that $I_j R$ are equal to each other. Our aim is to show that this won't happen. In fact, we will show something more general.\r\n\r\nLet $R \\subseteq S$ be rings. Call $S$ a direct summand of $R$ if it is a direct summand as a $R$-module, that is $S = R \\oplus R'$ as $R$-modules. Then it is easy to see that if this is the case, then for any ideal $I$ of $R$, one has $IS \\cap R = I$. Indeed, if $r = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i_k s_k$, then writing $s_k  = r_k + r'_k$, we have \r\n$$r - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i_k r_k = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i_k r'_k$$\r\nand since $R \\cap R' = \\{ 0 \\}$, the above expression must also be $ = 0$ and so $r = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i_k r_k \\in I$ as desired. In particular, if $R$ was a direct summand of $R^G$ then the stabilization of $\\{ I_j R \\}$ immediately implies that of $\\{ I_j \\}$, giving us the Noetherianess of $R$. \r\n\r\nTo show that $R$ is a direct summand of $R^G$, it suffices to give a $R$-module projection map $\\pi: R \\to R^G$ such that $\\pi \\circ i$ is the identity on $R^G$ where $i: R^G \\to R$ is the inclusion map. We now borrow an idea from representation theory: define $\\pi : R \\to R^G$ by\r\n$$\\pi(r) = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{g \\in G} g \\cdot r.$$\r\nThis only works if $|G|$ is coprime to the characteristic of $K$, but assuming that, it is easy to verify $\\pi$ satisfies the required properties and thus proving that $R$ is indeed a direct summand of $R^G$ and hence $R^G$ is Noetherian as $R$ is.\r\n\r\nI would like to point out that while this proof only works for certain characteristic, the one via Artin-Tate lemma works for all of them. A key thing that was considered is the construction $P(t) = \\prod_{g \\in G} (t - g \\cdot r)$ and I have found that this is a very useful thing to consider when dealing with arbitrary characteristic. For instance, if we had a non-zero function $f$ on some vector space $V$ carrying a $G$-action, then if we wanted to symmetrize $f$ to be invariant under $G$, a possible consideration is $\\sum_{g \\in G} g \\cdot f$. But if $V$ had positive characteristic then this could be possibly just the zero function, especially if the stabilizer of each $v \\in V$ had cardinality $p$. You can try other possible symmetrizations but there will always be a possibility that it ends up at $0$. On the other hand, if we take \r\n$$0 =  (f - g \\cdot f) = f^n + a_1 \\cdot f^(n-1)  + \\cdots + a_n$$\r\nwhere $a_i$ are functions invariant under $G$, then there must exist at least one $a_i$ where $a_i$ is non-zero as otherwise, $f$ must be the zero function."
